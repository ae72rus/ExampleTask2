# Task
You need to write a program that plots graphs of keyboard typing statistics.
The program consists of 2 parts.

One part runs on one computer and opens a window in which a person can type text.

The other part runs on another computer, connects to the first one over the network, and displays a graph in close to real time.
The graph can display the following indicators (select one or more as desired):

- Instantaneous typing speed
- Average typing speed
- Printing uniformity
- Value of the pressed key
- Average key value

It is advisable to write the program in C# WPF using a reactive approach to programming.

# Note
Writing tests is ignored due to time savings.

TranCons.Input - an application with a window where you need to type text
TranCons.Monitor - an application with a "monitor" that visualizes data
